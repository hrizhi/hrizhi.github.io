This allows you to generate new panda images.</p> </blockquote> <p>GANs are made of two deep learning models that compete against each other (hence, the term adversarial):</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Generator (Forger)</strong> This neural network receives a sample from a random distribution $Z$ (noise). It transforms it into something (a panda) that looks like it came from the target/true distribution(panda images). This is done by learning a mapping between the input samples and the images in the true distribution, during the training phase.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Discriminator (Detective)</strong></p> <p>This neural network receives images from the true distribution $X$ as well as the new/fake images $X̂$ generated by the generator. The goal is to discriminate between real and generated images. The network is trained to output 0 for a generated image and 1 for a real image.</p> </li> </ol> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/gan/gan1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/gan/gan1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/gan/gan1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/gan/gan1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="GAN" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> GAN </div> <p>The generator’s tries to fool the discriminator into thinking that its generated images belong to the true distribution. On the other hand, the discriminator tries to catch all the fake/generated images. This encourages the generator to learn the true probability distribution more closely and generate such real looking images that the discriminator’s output converges to 0.5, i.e., it is not able to distinguish fake from real.</p> <p>The generator’s output improves throughout the training iterations.</p> <p>Supervised or unsupervised learning? You saw that the generator model of the GAN learns the target probability distribution (looks for patterns in the input data) to generate new content; this is known as generative modeling.</p> <p>Generative modeling is an unsupervised task where the model is not told what kind of patterns to look for in the data and there is no error metric to improve the model. However, the training process of the GAN is posed as a supervised learning problem with the help of a discriminator. The discriminator is a supervised classifier that distinguishes between real and generated images. This allows us to devise a supervised loss function for the GAN.</p> <h5 id="loss-function">Loss Function</h5> <p>The binary cross entropy loss function for the GAN is as follows:</p> <p>The term D(x) is the probability that a data point belongs to class real, whereas the term 1-D(G(z)) is the probability of belonging to class fake. The loss function works by measuring how far away from the actual value (real 1 or fake 0) the prediction is for each class and then averages the errors (Expectation) to obtain the final loss.</p> <p>Discriminator’s aim The discriminator wants to distinguish between real and fake. Earlier, you mentioned the final form of the loss. Let’s see how the discriminator’s loss function is derived from the original form of the binary cross-entropy loss as follows:</p> <p>Loss(D(x),1)=[1∗log(D(x))+(1−1)∗log(1−D(x)]</p> <p>When you have the image coming from the generator, the function takes the form:</p> <p>Loss(D(G(z)),0)=[0∗log(D(G(z))+(1−0)∗log(1−D(G(z))]</p> <p>The terms (1) and (2) are added to achieve the final loss. To see why the discriminator maximises this loss.</p> <p>You can observe that the discriminator needs to maximize the $1st$ term in order to correctly predict “1” for the real input image. Also, it needs to maximize the second term to correctly predict “0” for the generated input image.</p> <h5 id="generators-aim">Generator’s Aim</h5> <p>The generator aims to generate such an image that the discriminator classifies it as real or 1. The generator’s loss function is the same as when the discriminator receives generated image, i.e.,</p> <p>Loss(D(G(z)),0)=log((1−D(G(z))))</p> <p>However, unlike the discriminator, the generator minimizes this term . Let’s look at the plot again.</p> <p>As you can see in the log plot of the second term, in order to fool the discriminator (D(G(z))=1), you need to minimize the term.</p> <h5 id="training-the-gans">Training the GANs</h5> <p>The generator and discriminator are trained alternatively.</p> <p>For training the discriminator, the weights of the generator model are frozen. Two mini-batches are taken. One is from the real images data. The other consists of generated images obtained by feeding random noise samples to the generator. There are no labels associated with this data. However, the discriminator still learns due to the formulation of the loss function, which that we discussed earlier. The discriminator updates its weights to maximize the terms leading to fake images being classified as 0 and real as 1.</p> <p>For training the generator, the weights of the discriminator model are frozen. A mini-batch is taken from the noise. Once again there are no labels, but the model updates its weights to minimize the loss term, leading to fake images being classified as 1.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Notes&quot;]"/><category term="deep-learning"/><category term="math"/><category term="code"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generative adversarial networks belong to the set of generative models in contrast to discriminative models, i.e., they focus on learning the unknown probability distribution of the input data to generate similar inputs rather than just classifying inputs as belonging to a certain class.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Research: My two cents</title><link href="https://hrishikeshh.github.io/blog/2024/research/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Research: My two cents"/><published>2024-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://hrishikeshh.github.io/blog/2024/research</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hrishikeshh.github.io/blog/2024/research/"><![CDATA[<blockquote> <p>“Writing is a really good way of finding out what you are talking about…” –Someone.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“If you keep your brilliant ideas to yourself and you don’t tell anybody, you might as well not have them.”</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h2 id="blogs-worth-slow-reading">Blogs worth slow reading</h2> <ul> <li><a href="http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html"><strong>An Opinionated Guide to ML Research</strong></a> by <a href="http://joschu.net/index.html"><em>John Schulman</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://michaelnielsen.org/blog/principles-of-effective-research/">Principles of Effective Research</a> by <a href="https://michaelnielsen.org/"><em>Michael Nielsen</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">You and Your Research</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming"><em>Richard Hamming</em></a></li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Research"/><category term="research"/><category term="deep-learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[These are the nuggets of wisdom I found in the corners of internet while doing my own stint of research.

</code></pre></div></div> <hr/> <h3 id="fast--slow-pointer"><em>Fast &amp; Slow pointer</em></h3> <ul> <li> <p>Similar to the two pointers pattern, the fast and slow pointers pattern uses two pointers to traverse an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterable data structure</code> at different speeds. It’s usually used to identify distinguishable features of <strong>directional data structures</strong>, such as a linked list or an array.</p> </li> <li> <p>The pointers can be used to traverse the array or list in either direction, however, one moves faster than the other. Generally, the slow pointer moves forward by a factor of one, and the fast pointer moves by a factor of two in each step. However, the speed can be adjusted according to the problem statement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unlike the two pointers approach, which is concerned with data values, the fast and slow pointers approach is used to determine data structure traits using indices in arrays or node pointers in linked lists. The approach is commonly used to detect cycles in the given data structure, so it’s also known as <strong>Floyd’s cycle detection algorithm</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The key idea is that the pointers start at the same location, but they move forward at different speeds. If there is a cycle, the two are bound to meet at some point in the traversal. To understand the concept, think of two runners on a track. While they start from the same point, they have different running speeds. If the race track is a circle, the faster runner will overtake the slower one after completing a lap. On the other hand, if the track is straight, the faster runner will end the race before the slower one, hence never meeting on the track again. The fast and slow pointers pattern uses the same intuition.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Does my problem match this pattern?</em></strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>Yes</em></strong>, if either of these conditions is fulfilled:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Either as an intermediate step, or as the final solution, the problem requires identifying:</p> <ul> <li>the first $x \%$ of the elements in a linked list, or,</li> <li>the element at the $k-way$ point in a linked list, for example, the middle element, or the element at the start of the second quartile, etc.</li> <li>the $k^{th}$ last element in a linked list</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Solving the problem requires detecting the presence of a cycle in a linked list.</p> </li> <li> <p>Solving the problem requires detecting the presence of a cycle in a sequence of symbols.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong><em>No</em></strong>, if either of these conditions is fulfilled:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The input data cannot be traversed in a linear fashion, that is, it’s neither in an array, nor in a linked list, nor in a string of characters.</p> </li> <li> <p>The problem can be solved with two pointers traversing an array or a linked list at the same pace.</p> </li> </ul> </blockquote> <p><strong>Real-world problems</strong></p> <p>Many problems in the real world use the fast and slow pointers pattern. Let’s look at some examples.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong><em>Symlink verification</em></strong>: Fast and slow pointers can be used in a symlink verification utility in an operating system. A symbolic link, or symlink, is simply a shortcut to another file. Essentially, it’s a file that points to another file. Symlinks can easily create loops or cycles where shortcuts point to each other. To avoid such occurrences, a symlink verification utility can be used. Similar to a linked list, fast and slow pointers can detect a loop in the symlinks by moving along the connected files or directories at different speeds.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><em>Compiling an object-oriented program</em></strong>: Usually, programs are not contained in a single file. Particularly, for large applications, modules can be divided into different files for better maintenance. Dependency relationships are then defined to specify the order of compilation for these files. However, sometimes, there might be cyclic dependencies that can lead to an error. Fast and slow pointers can be used to identify and remove these cycles for seamless compilation and execution of the program.</p> </li> </ul> <hr/> <h3 id="linked-list-fast-and-slow-pointer">Linked List: Fast and slow pointer</h3> <blockquote> <p>a.k.a. <strong><em>Floyd’s cycle detection</em></strong></p> </blockquote> <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">fn</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">ListNode</span> <span class="n">head</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

He was working at RAND under a Secretary of Defence who had a pathological fear towards the word “research” so he settled on the term “Dynamic” since it will be difficult to give meaning to it and not even a congressman could object to it. Basically it sounded cool.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For a conceptual understanding, let’s start with a classical example of <strong>Fibonacci Numbers</strong>.</p> <p>For given \(F(n)\), return the value for any given n.</p> \[\displaylines{ F(n) = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \text{if $n = 0$}\\ 1, &amp; \text{if $n = 1$}\\ F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), &amp; \text{if $n &gt; 1$} \end{cases} }\] <ul> <li> <p>Then Subproblem graph for Fibonacci will be :-</p> <pre><code class="language-mermaid">  graph TB

This is approximately \(O(1.618^n)\). Still awful, but a little better than the initial assumption of \(O(2^n)\).</p> <p><br/></p> <p>But if you closely notice in the function call tree, the computations are being re-done and hence adding complexities.

(e.g. Merge sort function call tree).</p> <p>In comparison, in the case of fibonacci sequence, some problems would have out degree larger than one, which makes the network a graph instead of a tree structure. This characteristics is directly induced by the fact that the <strong><em>subproblems overlap</em></strong> – that is, <strong><em>subproblems share subprolems</em></strong>. For example, <em>f(4)</em> and f(3) share f(2), and f(3) and f(2) shares f(1).</p> <blockquote> <p>💡 Dynamic programming is simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into <strong>simpler sub-problems</strong> in a recursive manner.</p> </blockquote> </li> </ul> <h3 id="22-why-it-is-required-">2.2 Why it is required ?</h3> <p>Dynamic programming is an optimization methodology over the complete search solutions for typical optimization problems. Dynamic Programming’s core principle is to solve each subproblem only once by saving and reusing its solution. Therefore, comparing with its naive counterpart – <em>Complete Search</em>:</p> <ol> <li>Dynamic Programming avoids the redundant recomputation met in its compete search counterpart as demonstrated in the last section.</li> <li>Dynamic Programming uses additional memory as a trade-off for better computation/time efficiency; it serves as an example of a time-space trade-off. In most cases, the space overhead is well-worthy; it can decrease the time complexity dramatically from exponential \(O(K^n)\) to polynomial level \(O(n)\).</li> </ol> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="23-where-can-it-be-implemented">2.3 Where can it be implemented?</h3> <p>Dynamic programming problems are normally asked in its certain way and its naive solution shows certain time complexity (mostly exponential). So for a clear understanding I would like to put it this way which is way more simpler thant textbooks by providing the situations when to use or not to use dynamic programming as Do’s and Do-nots.</p> <p><strong>Do’s</strong> : Dynamic programming fits for the optimizing the following problems which are either exponential or polynomial complexity using complete search :-</p> <ol> <li>Optimization: Compute the maximum or minimum value;</li> <li>Counting: Count the total number of solutions;</li> <li>Checking if a solution work</li> </ol> <p><strong>Do Nots</strong> : In the following cases we might not be able to apply Dynamic Programming:</p> <ol> <li>When the naive solution has a low time complexity already such as \(O(n^2)\) or \(O(n^3)\).</li> <li>When the input dataset is a set while not an array or string or matrix, 90% chance we will not use DP.</li> <li>When the overlapping subproblems apply but it is not optimization problems thus we can not identify the suboptimial substructure property and thus find its recurrence function. For example, same problem context as in Dos but instead we are required to obtain or print all solutions, this is when we need to retreat back to the use of DFS+memo(top-down) instead of DP.</li> </ol> <h2><br/></h2> <h3 id="24-how-can-it-be-implementedapproached-">2.4 How can it be implemented/approached ?</h3> <blockquote> <p>💡 Note : While teaching, the educator should give a bird eye overview about the two possible approaches to students so that they can have a mental framework to place the details mentioned in <strong><em>Illustration section</em></strong> later.</p> </blockquote> <p>In this section, we have provided two forms of dynamic programming solutions: memoization and tabulation, as two different ways of bringing the caching mechanism into practice. In this section, we focus on the iterative tabulation and generalize its four key elements and practical guidelines for importants steps.</p> <ul> <li>Dynamic programming for optimizing the problems fall into the broadly three categories: <ol> <li><strong>Optimization</strong>: Compute the maximum or minimum value;</li> <li><strong>Counting</strong>: Count the total number of solutions;</li> <li><strong>Checking</strong> if a solution works or not, True or False;</li> </ol> </li> <li>Now to fit in the above 3 categories, the problem must show 2 essential properties : <ul> <li>Overlapping subproblems.</li> <li>Optimal substructures.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Before understanding the approach, we must get familiar with these two properties of the subproblems : -</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>What are Overlapping Subproblems ?</strong></p> <p>When a recursive algorithm revisits the same subproblem repeatedly, we say that the optimization problem has overlapping subproblems. where one subproblem is reached by multiple other subproblem. When subproblems are disjoint such as seen in merge sort and binary search, dynamic programming would not be helping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Optimal Substructure</strong></p> <p>A given problem has optimal substructure property if the optimal solution of the given problem can be obtained by using optimal solutions of its subproblems. Only if optimal substructure property applied we can find the recurrence relation function which is a key step in implementation as we have seen from the above two examples. Optimal substructures varies across problem domains in two ways:</p> <ol> <li>Subproblem space: how many subproblems an optimal solution to the original problem uses. For example, in Fibonacci sequence, each integer in range [0, n] is a subproblem, which makes the n + 1 as the total subproblem space. The state of each subproblem is the optimal solution for that subproblem which is f(n).</li> <li> <p><strong>State Choice</strong>: how many choices we have in determining which subproblem(s) to use to decide the recurrence function for the current state. In Fibonacci sequence, each state only relies on two preceding states as seen in recurrence function f(i) = f(i − 1) + f(i − 2), thus making it constant cost.</p> <p>Subproblem space and state choice together not only formulates the recurrent relation with which we very much have the implementation in hand. Together they also decide the time and space complexity we will need to tackle our dynamic programming problems</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>Two Forms of Dynamic Programming Solution</strong></p> <ul> <li>There are two ways either <strong>recursive</strong> or <strong>iterative</strong> in general to add space mechanism into naive complete search to construct our dynamic programming solution.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>💡 But do remember that we cannot eliminate recursive thinking completely. We will always have to define a recursive relation irrespective of the approach we use.</p> </blockquote> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/dp/design.png" alt="Design"/></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Top-down + Memoization (recursive DFS)</strong></p> <p>We start from larger problem (from top) and recursively search the subproblems space (to bottom) until the leaf node. This method is built on top of <em>Depth-First Graph Search</em> together with Divide and Conquer Methodology which treat each node as a subproblem and return its solution to its caller so that it can be used to build up its solution.</p> <p>Following a top-down fashion as is in divide and conquer, along the process, in the recursive call procedure, a hashmap is relied on to save and search solutions. The memoization works in such way that at the very first time that the subproblem is solved it will be saved in the hashmap, and whenever this problem is met again, it finds the solution and returns it directly instead of computing again.</p> <p>The key elements of this style of dynamic programming is:</p> <ol> <li>Define subproblem;</li> <li>Develop solution using Depth-first Graph search and Divide and conquer (<em>leave alone the recomputation</em>).</li> <li>Adding hashmap to save and search the state of each subproblem</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Bottom-up + Tabulation (iterative)</strong></p> <p>Different from the last method, which use recursive calls, in this method, we approach the subproblems from the smallest subproblems, and construct the solutions to larger subproblems using the tabulaized result. The nodes in the subproblem graph is visited in a reversed topological sort order. This means that to reconstruct the state of current subproblem, all dependable (predecessors) have already be computed and saved.</p> <ul> <li>The memoization method applies better for beginners that who have decent understanding of divide and conquer. However, once you have enough practice, the tabulation should be more intuitive compared with recursive solution. Usually, dynamic programming solution to a problem refers to the solution with tabulation.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>Five Steps to Solve Dynamic Programming</strong></p> <p>This is a general guideline for dynamic programming – memoization or tabulation. Key advice – being “flexbile”.</p> <p>Given a real problem, all in all, we are credited with our understanding of the concepts in computer science. Thus, we should not be too bothered or stressed that if you can not come up with a “perfect” answer.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Step 1</strong> : Read the question: search for the key words of the problem patterns: counting, checking, or maximum/minimum.</li> <li><strong>Step 2</strong> : Come up with the most naive solution ASAP: analyze its time complexity. Is it a typical DFS solution? Try draw a SUBPROBLEM GRAPH to get visualization. Is there space for optimization?</li> <li><strong>Step 3</strong> : Is there overlapping? Can you define the optimal substructure/recurrence function?</li> <li><strong>Step 4</strong> : If the conclusion is YES, try to define the Five key elements so that we can solve it using the preferable tabulation. If you can figure it out intuitively just like that, great! What to do if not? Maybe retreat to use memoization, which is a combination of divide and conquer, DFS, and memoization.</li> <li><strong>Step 5</strong>. What if we were just so nervous that or time is short, we just go ahead and implement the complete search solution instead. With implementation is better than nothing. With the implementation in hand, maybe we can figure it out later.</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>Five Key Elements of Tabulation</strong></p> <p>As the first guideline of Tabulation, we summarize the four key elements for the implementation of dynamic programming:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Step 4.1</strong> : <strong>Subproblem and State</strong></p> <p>Define what the subproblem space, what is the optimal state/solution for each subproblem. In practice, it would normally be the the total/the maximum/minimum for subproblem. This requires us to know how to divide problem into subproblems.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Step 4.2</strong> : <strong>State Transfer (Recurrence) Function</strong>:</p> <p>Derive the function that how we can get current state by using result from previous computed state(s). This requires us to identify the optimal substructure and know how to make state choice.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Step 4.3</strong> : <strong>Assignment and Initialization</strong>:</p> <p>Followed by knowing the subproblem space, we typically assign a space data structure and initialize its values. For base or edge cases, we might need to initialize different than the other more general cases</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Step 4.4</strong> : <strong>Iteration</strong>:</p> <p>Decide the order of iterating through the subproblem space thus we can scan each subproblem/state exact and only once. Using the subproblem graph, and visit the subproblms in reversed topological order is a good way to go.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Step 4.5</strong> : <strong>Answer</strong>:</p> <p>Decide which state or a combination of all states such as the the max/min of all the state is the final result needed.</p> </li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>Complexity Analysis</strong></p> <ul> <li>The complexity analysis of the tabulation is seemingly more straightforward compared with its counterpart – the recursive memoization. For the tabulation, we can simply draw conclusion without any prior knowledge of the dynamic programming by observing the for loops and its recurrence function. However, for both variant, there exists a common analysis method.</li> <li>The core points to analyze complexity involving dynamic programming is: <ol> <li>The subproblem space <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|S|</code>, that is the total number of subproblems; and</li> <li>The number of state choice needed to construct each state <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|C|</code>.</li> </ol> <p>By multiplying these two points, we can draw the conclusion of its time complexity as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(|S|.|C|)</code>.</p> </li> <li>For example, if the subproblem space is n and if each state i relies on <ol> <li>Only one or two previous states as we have seen in the example of Fibonacci Sequence, it makes the time complexity <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(n)</code></em>; and</li> <li>All previous states in range <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[0, i − 1]</code> as seen in the example of Longest Increasing Subsequence, which can be viewed as \(O(n)\) to solve each subproblem, this brings up the complexity up to \(O(n^2)\).</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>To help you decide which style that you should take when presented with a DP solution, here’s the trade-off comparison between top-down Memoization and bottom-up Tabulation</p> <p><br/></p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th> </th> <th>Memoization</th> <th>Tabulation</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Pros</strong></td> <td>1.

This problem type gives the foundational aspect for other variants too. Hence a deeper understanding of this problem type is required for understanding the inner working of Dynamic Programming.</p> <blockquote> <p>💡 The Knapsack problem, as the name suggests, is the problem faced by a person who has a knapsack with a limited capacity and wants to carry the most valuable items. In other words, we are given <em>N</em> items, each having a specific weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum capacity.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Our job is to put as many items as possible in the knapsack such that the cumulative weight of the items doesn’t exceed the knapsack’s capacity, and the cumulative value of the items in the knapsack is maximized.</p> </blockquote> <p><br/></p> <p><strong><em>Problem statement</em></strong> : The <strong>0/1 Knapsack</strong> is a special case of the Knapsack problem where item selection has some constraints. In general, the following restrictions are applied:</p> <ul> <li>A maximum of one item can be selected of each kind, that is, the number of items of each kind in the knapsack is either zero or one.</li> <li>We can’t take a fraction of an item, that is, we either have to take the complete item or leave it.</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <blockquote> <p>💡 Mathematically, Given a set of <em>n</em> items, each with a value \(v_i\) and weight \(w_i\), and a knapsack with maximum weight capacity <em>C</em> , we have the following target:</p> </blockquote> \[Maximize \sum_{i=1}^n x_i v_i\] \[Subject~~to \sum_{i=1}^n x_i v_i \ \leq C\] <p>with \(x_i ∈ \{0,1\}\) representing the number of instances of item <em>i</em> in the knapsack.</p> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li>Before proceeding, let’s check if the students have understood the problem statement type. Here are few problem statements, let’s see if these are 0/1 Knapsack problem type or other types. <ul> <li>Given a set of positive numbers, find a triplet whose sum is equal to a given number S (✅ 0/1 Knapsack)</li> <li>Select one car of each model to be displayed in the showroom so that the overall worth of the displayed cars is maximized. (✅ 0/1 Knapsack)</li> <li>Given an unlimited number of tennis balls, calculate the number of balls that can be placed in a box. (❌ Other type)</li> <li>Given an array of numbers, calculate the number of ways in which its elements can be selected to make sum S. (❌ Other type)</li> <li>Plan a vacation in such a way that the maximum number of cities is visited in the specified budget. (✅ 0/1 Knapsack)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Let’s start solving the problem with our proposed Five Step Framework from section 2.4</p> <p><strong>Step 1 - 3</strong></p> <ul> <li>Search for keyword aiming for optimization : <strong>Maximize</strong> the value of whole knapsack.</li> <li>Start with Naive Solution just to get an approximate idea of time complexity and the typical DFS approach. It will be a good idea to start with Subproblem graph.</li> <li>Check for overlapping subproblems : Yes.</li> <li>Can a recurrence relation be defined among subproblems : Yes.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p> <ul> <li>Now we have two options here to proceed with : Memoization or Tabulation. Let’s first explore the Tabulation Approach :-</li> <li><strong>Step 4.3 : Assignment and Initialization</strong> <ul> <li>Assign a space datastructure and initialize its base, edge and normal values.</li> <li>Since this is profit maximizing problem hence the least amount of profit in case of a null set or null capacity will 0.

Hence, we will select items with weights 1 and 2, as they give us the maximum value of 15.</p> <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p> \[\displaylines{ 1≤ capacity ≤10^4\\ 1≤ values.length ≤10^3\\ 1≤ values[i] ≤10^4\\ 1≤ weights[i] ≤ capacity\\ weights.length == values.length\\ }\] <table> <thead> <tr> <th>No.</th> <th>capacity</th> <th>weights</th> <th>Values</th> <th>n</th> <th>Maximum Value</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>30</td> <td>[10, 20, 30]</td> <td>[22, 33, 44]</td> <td>3</td> <td>55</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>5</td> <td>[1, 2, 3, 5]</td> <td>[10, 5, 4, 8]</td> <td>4</td> <td>15</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>Naive approach</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>A naive approach is to find all combinations of items such that their combined weight is less than the capacity of the knapsack and the total value is maximized.</p> <p>For example, we have the following list of values and weights with the capacity of 55:</p> \[\displaylines{values: [3,5,2,7]\\ weights: [3,1,2,4]\\}\] </li> </ul> <p>To find the maximum value, we try all the possible combinations:</p> \[3+5 (total~weight~4) = 8\\ 3+2 (total~weight~5) = 5\\ 5+2 (total~weight~3) = 7\\ 5+7 (total~weight~5) = 12\\\] <p>The calculation above shows that we need a recursive solution to make all possible combinations. In other words, we divide the problem into sub-problems, and for each item, if its weight is less than the capacity, we check whether we should place it in the knapsack.</p> <p>Let’s implement the algorithm as discussed above:</p> <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">java.util.stream.*</span><span class="o">;</span>

This is because we have two possible choices every time, either to include the item or not.</p> <p><strong>Space complexity</strong></p> <p>As the maximum depth of the recursive call tree is <em>n</em>, and each call stores its data on the stack, the space complexity of this approach is <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>).</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Optimized solution using dynamic programming</strong></p> <p>Now, let’s improve the recursive solution using top-down and bottom-up approaches.</p> <p><strong>Top-down solution</strong></p> <p>The top-down solution, commonly known as the <strong>memoization</strong> technique, is an enhancement of the recursive solution. It overcomes the problem of calculating redundant solutions over and over again by storing them in a table.</p> <p>In the recursive approach, the two variables that kept changing in each call were the total weight of the knapsack and the number of items we had. So, we’ll use these two variables to define each distinct subproblem. Therefore, we need a 2-D array to store these values and the result of any given subproblem when we encounter it for the first time. At any later time, if we encounter the same sub-problem, we can return the stored result from the table with an \(O(1)\) lookup instead of recalculating that subproblem.</p> <p>Let’s implement the algorithm as discussed above:</p> <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">java.util.stream.*</span><span class="o">;</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p><strong>Time complexity</strong></p> <p>We avoided redundant calculations in this approach by storing all the intermediate results in a 2-D array in <em>O</em>(1) time. Therefore, the time complexity of this approach is reduced to \(O(n×capacity)\), where <em>n</em> is the number of items.</p> <p><strong>Space complexity</strong></p> <p>We now need \(O(n×capacity)\) space in memory to store intermediate values.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Bottom-up solution</strong></p> <p>The bottom-up solution, also known as the <strong>tabulation</strong> technique, is an iterative method of solving dynamic programming problems. Here, we will create a 2-D array of size \((n + 1)∗(capacity + 1).\) The row indicates the values of the available items, and the column shows the capacity of the knapsack at any given point.</p> <p>We will initialize the array so that when the row or column is 0, the value in the table will also be 0. Next, we will check if the weight of an item is less than the capacity. If yes, we have two options: either we can add the item to the knapsack, or we can skip it. If we include the item, the optimal solution is the maximum of the two values. Otherwise, if the weight of an item is greater than the capacity, then we don’t include the item in the knapsack.</p> <p>The algorithm work as follows:</p> <ul> <li>In the first row, we have no items to pick from, so regardless of the knapsack’s capacity, we can only accumulate a value of 0.</li> <li>In the second row, we can only pick the first item. With a knapsack of capacity 1, we wouldn’t be able to pick this item. If the knapsack capacity is 2, we can pick this item. As the knapsack capacity increased beyond <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value[0]</code>, we couldn’t get any more value because there was only one item to choose from.</li> <li> <p>In the third row, we have the first two items available to be picked. For a knapsack of capacity c, we can either try to pick the second item or skip it. If we choose to skip an item, the value we can accumulate is the value one can obtain using only the first item and a knapsack of capacity c. This is already known and stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dp[1][c]</code>.</p> <p>If we decide to pick this item, it will take up a weight of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weights[1]</code> in the knapsack while contributing an additional value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">values[1]</code>. However, we need to track how much value we can accumulate with the remaining capacity in the knapsack, i.e., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">capacity - weights[1]</code> while using only the first item. This value is already stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dp[1][c-weights[1]]</code>. So, the total value, in this case, becomes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">values[1] + dp[1][c-weights[1]]</code>. Since we’re trying to maximize the value, we’ll pick the more valuable of the two choices, i.e., picking or not picking the second item.</p> </li> <li> <p>In general, the cell in row <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code> can be filled with the following formula:</p> <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="n">dp</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">][</span><span class="n">j</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="err"> </span><span class="nc">Math</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">max</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)+</span><span class="n">dp</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">][</span><span class="n">j</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">weights</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)],</span><span class="err"> </span><span class="n">dp</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="err"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="err"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">][</span><span class="n">j</span><span class="o">]);</span>

If you are like most people, it was probably suddenly forced upon you during your first math or CS class where you had to start writing proofs, with minimal guidance on how to get started other than something along the lines of “hey, check out this link on how to get things setup, and here are some basic commands, now go wild!”.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this meant that while many people have good operational knowledge of LaTeX and can get the job done, there are still many small mistakes and best practices which are not followed, which are not corrected by TAs as they are either not severe enough to warrant a note, or perhaps even the TAs themselves are not aware of them.</p> <p>In this post, we cover some common mistakes that are made by LaTeX practitioners (even in heavily cited papers), and how to address them. This post assumes that the reader has some working knowledge of LaTeX.</p> <h2 id="typesetting-as-a-form-of-art">Typesetting as a Form of Art</h2> <p>It is important to get into the right mindset whenever you typeset a document. You are not simply “writing” a document — you are crafting a work of art that combines both the precision and creativity of your logical thinking, as well as the elegance of a beautifully typeset writing. The amount of attention and care you put into the presentation is indicative of the amount of thought you put into the content. Therefore, having good style is not only delightful and aesthetically pleasing to read, but it also serves to establish your ethos and character. One can tell that someone puts a lot of effort into their work and takes great pride in them when they pay attention even to the smallest of details.</p> <p>Furthermore, adopting good practices also helps to avoid you making typographical mistakes in your proof, such as missing parenthesis or wrong positioning. This could often lead to cascading errors that are very annoying to fix when you discover them later on. There are ways to replicate the strict typechecking of statically typed languages to ensure that mistakes in your expressions can be caught at compile-time.</p> <h2 id="common-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them">Common Mistakes, and How To Fix Them</h2> <p>In the following section, we take a look at common mistakes that people make, and how they can be avoided or fixed. We cover style mistakes first, since the ideas behind them are more general. All the screenshotted examples come from peer-reviewed papers that have been published to top conferences, so they are definitely very common mistakes and you shouldn’t feel bad for making them. The important thing is that you are aware of them now so that your style will gradually improve over time.</p> <h2 id="style-mistakes">Style Mistakes</h2> <p>We take a look at style mistakes, which impairs reader understanding, and makes it easy to commit other sorts of errors.</p> <h3 id="paired-delimiters">Paired Delimiters</h3> <p>Parenthesis, brackets, and pipes are examples of delimiters that are used to mark the start and end of formula expressions. As they come in pairs, a common mistake is accidentally leaving out the closing delimiter, especially for nested expressions. Even if you don’t forget to do so, there is the issue of incorrect sizing.</p> <p>For instance, consider the following way of expressing the Topologist’s sine curve, which is an example of a topology that is connected but not path connected:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-latex" data-lang="latex">T = <span class="k">\{</span> ( x, <span class="k">\sin</span> <span class="k">\frac</span><span class="p">{</span>1<span class="p">}{</span>x<span class="p">}</span> ) : x <span class="k">\in</span> (0, 1] <span class="k">\}</span> <span class="k">\cup</span> <span class="k">\{</span> ( 0, 0 ) <span class="k">\}</span></code></pre></figure> <p>which is rendered as follows:</p> \[T = \{(x, \sin \frac{1}{x} ) : x \in (0, 1] \} \cup \{ ( 0, 0 ) \}\] <p>The problem here is that the curly braces have the wrong size, as they should be large enough to cover the \(\sin \frac{1}{x}\) expression vertically.</p> <p>The wrong way of resolving this would be to use delimiter size modifiers, i.e <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\bigl, \Bigl, \biggl</code> paired with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\bigr, \Bigr, \biggr</code> and the like. This is tedious and error-prone, since it will even happily let you match delimiters with different sizes. Indeed, I came across the following formula in a paper recently, where the outer right square brackets was missing and the left one had the wrong size:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/paired_delim-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/paired_delim-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/paired_delim-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/latex-mistakes/paired_delim.webp" class="z-depth-1 center" width="500px" height="auto" style="object-fit: cover" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture><figcaption class="caption"> What happens when you don't use paired delimiters </figcaption> </figure> <p>The correct way to do this would be to use paired delimiters, which will automatically adjust its size based on its contents, and automatically result in a compile error if the matching right delimiter is not included, or nested at the wrong level. Some of them are given below:</p> <table class="table table-bordered table-sm"> <thead> <tr> <th>Raw LaTeX</th> <th>Rendered</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\left( \frac{1}{x} \right) </code></td> <td>\(\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\left[ \frac{1}{x} \right] </code></td> <td>\(\left[ \frac{1}{x} \right]\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\left\{ \frac{1}{x} \right\} </code></td> <td>\(\left\{ \frac{1}{x} \right\}\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\left\lvert \frac{1}{x} \right\lvert </code></td> <td>\(\left\lvert \frac{1}{x} \right\rvert\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\left\lceil \frac{1}{x} \right\rceil </code></td> <td>\(\left\lceil \frac{1}{x} \right\rceil\)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>In fact, to make things even simpler and more readable, you can declare paired delimiters for use based on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mathtools</code> package, with the following commands due to <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/">Ryan O’Donnell</a>:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-latex" data-lang="latex"><span class="c">% Make sure you include \usepackage{mathtools}</span>

This is pretty unfortunate as it still makes it error-prone. There is a <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1742/automatic-left-and-right-commands/1744#1744">proposed solution</a> floating around on StackExchange that relies on a custom command that makes auto-resizing the default, but it’s still a far cry from a parsimonious solution.</p> <h3 id="macros-for-saving-time-and-preventing-mistakes">Macros for Saving Time and Preventing Mistakes</h3> <p>Macros can be defined using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\newcommand</code> command. The basic syntax is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\newcommand{command_name}{command_definition}</code>. For instance, it might get tiring to always type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\boldsymbol{A}</code> to refer to a matrix \(\boldsymbol{A}\), so you can use the following macro:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-latex" data-lang="latex"><span class="c">% Macro</span>
<span class="k">\newcommand</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">\bA</span><span class="p">}{</span><span class="k">\boldsymbol</span><span class="p">{</span>A<span class="p">}}</span>

This is done by adding a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[n]</code> argument after your command name, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> is the number of arguments that it should take. You can then reference the positional arguments using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#1, #2,</code> and so on. Here, we create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\dotprod</code> macro that takes two arguments:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-latex" data-lang="latex"><span class="c">% Macros</span>
<span class="k">\newcommand</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="k">\dotprod</span><span class="p">}</span>[2]<span class="p">{</span><span class="k">\langle</span> #1, #2 <span class="k">\rangle</span><span class="p">}</span>

For instance, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\label{fig:myfig}</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\ref{fig:myfig}</code>. Including the type of the object in the tag helps to keep track of what it is and ensures that you are referencing it correctly, i.e making sure you write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Figure \ref{fig:myfig}</code> instead of accidentally saying something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Table \ref{fig:myfig}</code>.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>That was a lot, and I hope it has been a helpful read!

If you are like most people, it was probably suddenly forced upon you during your first math or CS class where you had to start writing proofs, with minimal guidance on how to get started. Unfortunately, this meant that while many people have good operational knowledge of LaTeX, there are still many small mistakes and best practices which are not followed, which are not corrected by TAs as they are either not severe enough to warrant a note, or perhaps even the TAs themselves are not aware of them. In this post, we cover some common mistakes that are made by LaTeX practitioners (even in heavily cited papers), and how to address them.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Java Collections</title><link href="https://hrishikeshh.github.io/blog/2023/java-collection/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Java Collections"/><published>2023-04-25T14:14:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-25T14:14:00+00:00</updated><id>https://hrishikeshh.github.io/blog/2023/java-collection</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hrishikeshh.github.io/blog/2023/java-collection/"><![CDATA[ <h2 id="collection-vs-collections">Collection v.s.
