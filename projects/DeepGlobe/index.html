Background</h2> <blockquote> <p>This project presumes some prior high level understanding of machine learning, deep neural networks, and working in Python, Keras, and TensorFlow 2.0.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Satellite Imagery</strong>: Satellite and remote sensing have seen great advances in recent years with one of the key catalyst being the price compression in launch costs from private space launch companies. This has allowed a wider cast of entities and organizations to deploy more satellites. The quality of imagery available to the general public, such as those from Sentinel-2, is also increasing; although still a ways from privately paid satellite services. Sentinel-2 has a typical pixel resolution of 10m band which means that each pixel represents 10m x 10m area.</p> <p><strong>CNNs</strong>: Convolutional Neural Networks are the state of the art neural network architecture for image recognition and computer vision tasks. There are many different variations of CNNs but they typically consist of convolution, pooling, and dense connected layers. CNNs perform much better than regular feed-forward neural networks in images due to its ability to reduce the resolution (dimensions) of an image onto feature maps while still encoding the key features of that image. This greatly reduces the complexity and computational need of the network. A typical CNN architecture is shown below.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/deepglobe/cnn-structure.webp-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/deepglobe/cnn-structure.webp-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/deepglobe/cnn-structure.webp-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/deepglobe/cnn-structure.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Typical structure of CNN" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A typical Convolutional Neural Network. Source: HML </div> <p><strong>FCNs</strong>: Typical CNNs perform great for classifying entire images but have difficulty classifying objects and segments within images. This is due to the fact that the convolution and pooling layers essentially encode the key features of the image down into ever smaller feature maps then feed that into fully connected layers, before a final Sigmoid or Softmax activation layer for final classification. The encoded features or final classifications cannot be easily mapped back to the original image.</p> <p>This is where <em>Long et al. (2015)’s Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)</em> come in. FCNs are just like CNNs except they have a series of convolutional and upsampling layers to mirror the convolutional and pooling layers in place of the dense connected layers. This allows the network to encode (downsample) and then decode (upsample) back into the original image’s resolution and spatial dimensions which allow for pixel-wise classification. If we edit the typical CNN layer from earlier, we might reach a configuration of something that looks like below.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/deepglobe/cnn-int.webp-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/deepglobe/cnn-int.webp-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/deepglobe/cnn-int.webp-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/deepglobe/cnn-int.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="CNN" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig: What a Fully Convolutional Network might look like.

There are many other types of problem sets like object detection, instance segmentation, and others which warrant their own discussions at a later date.</p> <p>Semantic Segmentation is determining which pixels in an image belongs to which class as shown below. For these problems, pixel-wise classification and localization of objects and edges within an image are important and therefore are good uses of FCNs.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/deepglobe/segmentation.webp-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/deepglobe/segmentation.webp-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/deepglobe/segmentation.webp-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/deepglobe/segmentation.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="segmentation" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig: Semantic Segmentation Example.

The architecture is shown below where the convolutional and max pooling layers perform an encoder operation on the image and the convolutional and upsampling layers perform the corresponding decoder operation into a full resolution output segmentation map. It also implements long skip connections (grey arrows) which concatenate feature maps from correspondingly sized layers in the encoder and decoder layers to help with localization of objects and edges within the image.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/deepglobe/u-net.webp-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/deepglobe/u-net.webp-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/deepglobe/u-net.webp-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/deepglobe/u-net.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="table" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig: Original U-Net architecture.

Final Thoughts</h2> <p>I hope that sharing this post and the source code can help others in the future whom may need it as reference for similar problem sets.</p> <p>One area of improvement for this project would be to try using an architecture specifically designed and pre-trained on semantic segmentation tasks for transfer learning instead of using the ResNet50 which is typically used for multi-class image classifications. Additionally, variations of DeepLab introduced by Chen et al. in Rethinking Atrous Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation⁷ have found to perform extremely well on image segmentation tasks. It may bode well to give the DeepLabv3 architecture a try.</p> <p>Lastly, I would like to apply the knowledge gained here to more specific problems in the climate and sustainability domain like:</p> <ul> <li>Forest and tree mapping to monitor deforestation</li> <li>Ice-cap monitoring</li> <li>Smart city/urban planning</li> <li>Endangered wildlife monitoring</li> </ul> <hr> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 हृषीकेश सिंह. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?b7816bd189846d29eded8745f9c4cf77"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.min.js" integrity="sha256-rjmgmaB99riUNcdlrDtcAiwtLIojSxNyUFdl+Qh+rB4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script> </script> </body> </html>
