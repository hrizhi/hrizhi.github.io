Hello👋,

I'm **Hrishikesh Singh** <span onclick="document.getElementById('pronunciation').play()" style="cursor: pointer;"> (*pronunciation*:🔊) </span>, a `machine learning researcher` specializing in `computer vision`, `deep learning`, and `reinforcement learning`, with a current focus on `infrared small target detection`. 

My work involves developing AI-driven solutions for real-world challenges in defense and finance, leveraging synthetic data pipelines and advanced deep learning techniques to improve model accuracy in complex environments.

Previously, I have worked on AI-powered geospatial analysis, mobile mapping, and infrastructure modeling, contributing to large-scale projects involving LiDAR, 3D topographic mapping, and GIS integration. I have also been involved in research on `natural language processing` and `causal-AI`, exploring AI applications across multiple domains.

[Get in touch](https://hrish.in/contact/).
